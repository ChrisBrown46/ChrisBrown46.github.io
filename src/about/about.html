          I’m Rakesh, one of the luckiest few whose day job is their hobby. I specialize in designing apps, websites and
          brand identities. Occasionally I also code websites. I’ve been freelancing since 2011 and the products I
          designed are being used by millions of people throughout the world.

          I consider myself a generalist who specializes in interface design. I do a bit of everything that goes into a
          digital
          product, from defining product goals and features to copy-writing to front-end development.

          I strive to create long-term work relationship with my clients. In all humbleness, many clients once worked
          with
          me
          usually come back to me for their future design needs and I’m really proud of it. I like working with
          individuals, small
          businesses and startups because of the freedom and flexibility I get and also perhaps because I don’t have to
          sit hours
          together on over-crowded meetings that go nowhere :)
